# Crystal Collector

## Description

A game where users click on different gems in order to make the score increase. They have a target number that they are trying to hit. If they go over, they lose. If they hit the number exactly, then they win.

## Under the Hood

The logic for this game is being managed by Java Script. The crystals are assigned a new value at the start of each new game using a random number generator. An event listener is listening for clicks on the photos of the gems, so that it knows when to add points. The target number of points is also being randomly generated. The paramaters for winning and losing are located within a conditional. If the current points === target points, then you win. If current points > target points you lose. A very simple game, but it was our first java script assignment and as such was difficult for fledgling programmers!
